# Two-factory-Authentication-System-for-Employees
-This project involves the development of a secure authentication app designed for office employees. The app generates a unique 6-digit passcode or OTP (One-Time Password) every two minutes, which is used alongside the employee's office username and password for logging into the office website.
-The primary objective of the app is to enhance authentication security by ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the office system. The passcodes are uniquely generated for each employee and are time-sensitive, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of breaches. This solution adheres to best practices in two-factor authentication (2FA), providing a reliable and secure method for user verification.

# How it works
-Initial Login: Employees visit the office login page and enter their username and password.
-Passcode Verification: Upon successful entry of the username and password, employees are redirected to a second page where they must input a unique 6-digit passcode generated by the mobile app.
-Access Grant: The passcode, valid for only two minutes, is verified. If correct, the employee is granted access to the office website.

# Festures
-Dynamic Passcodes: The app generates a unique 6-digit passcode every two minutes for each employee.
-Enhanced Security: Prevents unauthorized access by ensuring that both credentials and the passcode are required for authentication.
-User-Specific Codes: Passcodes are uniquely tied to each employee, ensuring secure and personalized access.

# App interface
1. User Registration
The app provides a "Register" option for new office users. Users fill out a registration form, entering details such as:
Full Name
Office Email Address
Contact Number
Desired Password
The entered information is securely sent to the app’s backend database. Admins verification system validate the user details. If approved, the user is added to the database and notified via email. If rejected, they are informed with a reason for denial.
2. User Login
Registered users can log in using their Office Email Address and Password. Credentials are verified against the database. If correct, the user gains access to the app interface. If incorrect, they receive an error message prompting them to re-enter or reset their password.
3. Password Recovery
If a user forgets their password, they can select the "Forgot Password" option. The app asks for the registered email address. A password reset link is sent to the user's email. Clicking the link redirects them to a secure page to set a new password. The new password is updated in the database, and the user can log in again.
4. Passcode Interface
Upon logging in, users are directed to the Passcode Interface. This screen displays:
A 6-digit passcode uniquely generated for the user.
A "Refresh" button that generates a new passcode immediately, resetting the timer.
5. Passcode Validation
The user views the passcode on the app and enters it on the office website's Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) page. The office website verifies the passcode against the app’s backend. If the passcode is correct and within the 2-minute window, the user gains access. If incorrect or expired, they are prompted to re-enter a valid passcode.
6. Security Features
Passcodes are generated using secure algorithms to ensure randomness and uniqueness. The Refresh button prevents users from having to wait if the timer runs out. The app uses secure encryption for user credentials and passcodes.
