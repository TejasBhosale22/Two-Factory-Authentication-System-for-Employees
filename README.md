# Two-factory-Authentication-System-for-Employees
-This project involves the development of a secure authentication app designed for office employees. The app generates a unique 6-digit passcode or OTP (One-Time Password) every two minutes, which is used alongside the employee's office username and password for logging into the office website.
-The primary objective of the app is to enhance authentication security by ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the office system. The passcodes are uniquely generated for each employee and are time-sensitive, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of breaches. This solution adheres to best practices in two-factor authentication (2FA), providing a reliable and secure method for user verification.

# How it works
-Initial Login: Employees visit the office login page and enter their username and password.
-Passcode Verification: Upon successful entry of the username and password, employees are redirected to a second page where they must input a unique 6-digit passcode generated by the mobile app.
-Access Grant: The passcode, valid for only two minutes, is verified. If correct, the employee is granted access to the office website.

# Festures
-Dynamic Passcodes: The app generates a unique 6-digit passcode every two minutes for each employee.
-Enhanced Security: Prevents unauthorized access by ensuring that both credentials and the passcode are required for authentication.
-User-Specific Codes: Passcodes are uniquely tied to each employee, ensuring secure and personalized access.
